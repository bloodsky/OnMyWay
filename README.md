# Concept


Everything is done by focusing on primary use case as you can see in this and the next topic (Time spent).
Our research is done all on library, API and problems related to our main goal. (Where is my bus?)


**Adapting dynamically ..**

was fundamental for us. We started with an idea too broad and based on the research conducted we managed to improve the shot  
Just look by yourself right here :   https://github.com/bloodsky/OnMyWay/blob/master/OnMyWay/app/src/main/res/drawable/On%20my%20way%20team.pdf


**Following the project plan ..**

wasn't really easy! with courage we have faced everything and now Marco is ready to know when he can get his bus!
